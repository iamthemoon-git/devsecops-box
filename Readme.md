# DevSecOps and Network Engineering Docker Image

This Docker image is tailored for DevSecOps professionals and network engineers, providing a suite of powerful tools for network analysis, security scanning, and vulnerability assessment. The image is based on Ubuntu and includes a range of command-line utilities to assist in auditing, diagnosing, and securing networks.

## Tools Included

Below is a brief overview of each tool included in the Docker image, along with simple installation and basic usage instructions.

### Nmap

- **Description**: Nmap is a network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thereby creating a "map" of the network. It is great for network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
- **Installation**: Nmap is included in the Docker image. To use it outside of Docker, install it via your package manager (e.g., `apt-get install nmap` on Debian/Ubuntu).
- **Basic Usage**: To scan a network, you can use `nmap -sS <target>`, where `<target>` is the IP address or hostname of the target system or network.

### TShark

- **Description**: TShark is the command-line version of Wireshark, allowing for network protocol analysis and capture in real-time. It provides detailed information about network traffic as seen by the host system.
- **Installation**: TShark is included in the Docker image. For external installation, use your package manager (e.g., `apt-get install tshark`).
- **Basic Usage**: To capture packets on a specific network interface, use `tshark -i <interface>`, replacing `<interface>` with the name of your network interface.

### Metasploit Framework

- **Description**: An advanced open-source platform for developing, testing, and using exploit code. It can be used to find security vulnerabilities in systems and to verify vulnerability mitigations.
- **Installation**: Included in the Docker image. For manual installation, it is typically installed via a package or directly from its GitHub repository.
- **Basic Usage**: Launch Metasploit with `msfconsole` from the command line. To search for exploits, use the `search` command within the msfconsole.

### Nikto

- **Description**: Nikto is a web server scanner which performs comprehensive tests against web servers for multiple items, including potentially dangerous files/programs, checks for outdated versions of servers, and version-specific problems.
- **Installation**: Nikto is included in the Docker image. It can be installed externally via package managers or from its official website.
- **Basic Usage**: To scan a website, use `nikto -h <website>`, replacing `<website>` with the URL or IP address of the web server you wish to scan.

### Sqlmap

- **Description**: An open-source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over database servers.
- **Installation**: Sqlmap is included in the Docker image. It can also be downloaded from its official website or GitHub repository.
- **Basic Usage**: To test a URL for SQL injection vulnerabilities, use `sqlmap -u "<URL>"`, where `<URL>` is the link to the page you wish to test.

### OpenSSL

- **Description**: OpenSSL is a robust, full-featured toolkit for the TLS and SSL protocols, and a general-purpose cryptography library.
- **Installation**: OpenSSL comes pre-installed on most Unix-like systems. It is included in the Docker image for convenience.
- **Basic Usage**: To generate a new RSA private key and corresponding certificate signing request (CSR), you can use `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr`.

## Building the Docker Image

To build the Docker image, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare the Dockerfile**: Save the provided Dockerfile in a new directory on your system.
2. **Build the Image**:
   Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile. Then run the following command to build the Docker image, replacing `devsecops-image` with your preferred image name:

   ```bash
   docker build -t devsecops-image .
# devsecops-box
